# GEO SYNC

GEO SYNC is a Flutter-based application that uses SignalR for real-time communication. It allows users to share and receive live location updates seamlessly. The app supports two user modes:

- **Receiver**: Receives and displays location updates sent by Other User.

## Features

- Real-time location sharing using SignalR.
- Two user modes: Sender and Receiver.
- Intuitive UI for toggling user modes and displaying connection status.
- Integration with GPS services for accurate location data.
